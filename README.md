# Encryption
  This post is intended to give a brief explanation of what are the encryption types, how they work and examples.


# Types of Encryption
  There are two types of encryption `symmetric` and `asymmetric`. The name derives from whether or not the same key is used for excryption or decryption
  
  
## Symmetric Encryption
  * In this type of encryption there is only one key (Private key), and all sides communicating use the same key for encryption and decryption. 
  * The main problem here is that the key needs to be shared in a very secure way, otherwise whoever intercepts the key will be able to decrypt data
  * The most widely used symmetric algorithms are AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
  * Examples of Symetric Encryption:
    * 
    
## Asymetric Encryption
  * Also known as public key encryption. There are two keys, where public key is used encrypt data and only the private key is able to decrypt it
  * The main problem for this type of encryption is the time/processing it takes to deal with enycrption/decryption, it is a lot higher than on symetric encryption
  * The most known asymetric key encryption algorithm are EIGamal, RSA, DSA, Elliptic curve techniques, PKCS.
  * Examples of Asymetric Encryption:
    * HTTPS websites (SSL)
    * SSH


# Asymetric Encryption in Digital Certificates
  * In cases of accessing secure web pages, a certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA). 
  * A certificate is a package of information that identifies a user (client) and a server. They most commonly contain the public key, identity owner and CA.
  * The communication between client and server is similar to this:
    * Client messages server to initiate communication
    * Server sends back an encrypted public key/certificate
    * Client checks the certificate
      * On their native browser they have a list of CA's and this is how the client test if the certificate is OK
    * If all is good with certificate, client creates and sends an encrypted key to the server
    * Server decrypts the key and delivers encrypted content with key to the client
    * Client decrypts the content completing the SSL/TLS handshake
  * The only different between having or not having a certificate on OSI layer is the fact that TLS(SSL) protocol gets added to the stack, like this:

```
- HTTP
- TLS (SSL)
- TCP
- IP
- Ethernet
```

## CA
  * In order for an TLS(SSL) certificate to be trusted, that certificate must have been issued by a CA
  * There are two types of certificate authorities (CAs)
    * Root CAs and Intermediate CAs
  * There are some layers of CA inside the certificate file. Ergo, if the user's browser cannot trust the first CA, the upper layer of CA on a certificate is tried to be validated by the same, until it reaches CA Root (if needed)
    * Basically if your certificate was generated by company "X", this company cannot simply assume every browser will trust its own certificate. In this case the next layer of CA might be the company "Y", which then trusts the CA "X" and is trusted by the user's browser
  * The format of these certificates is specified by the `X.509` standard



# TLS and SSL
  * They are both cryptographic *PROTOCOLS* that provides authentication and data encryption between server, machines, applications over network etc
  * You may be able to use both protocols with a web certificate as the protocol is not defined by the CA or the certificate itself, it is defined by the server configuration (whoever is hosting the site)

## SSL
  * SSL means Secure Socket Layers
  * SSL was originally developed by Netscape
  * SSL have been deprecated by IETF, on its last version - SSL 3.0 -, in 2015.(Internet Engineering Task Force)

## TLS
  * TLS means Transport Layer Security
  * Is an upgrade of SSL protocol (3.0)
  * Its most updated version is `1.3`
